//Javascript:- 
//it light weight , structural , interpreted programming langauge
//it mainly used for frontend and backend part

//Variable in JS:- it is used to store the value or data in the memory allocation, it just a name given to memory location of data/value 
//there are three types of data types
//1) LET- always used let if you want your code to excuted with not any hidden bugs and also let is declare once you can not delcare it again and again
//2) VAR- used as much as less because we can redclare it again and again then it leads to so many complex things
//3) CONST- Used when the data is constant means not chaning it value

console.log(a); //Cannot access 'b' before initialization
console.log(b); //got undefined output(which is bug in)
let a;
var b;
