//Operators:- by using different operators we can perform the some mathematical operation and can perform certain tasks
//[1]Arithmatic Operator:- +,-,/,*,%,**,++,--
let a=23;
let b=22;
console.log(a+b);
console.log(a-b);
console.log(a/b);
console.log(a*b);
let x=a++;
let y=++b;
console.log(x);
console.log(y);
console.log(a%b);

//[2]]Comparison operator: ==, ===.
//==:- loosely equality for comparison ,checked the value not datatypes
//eg - console.log(50=="50")==> returns true
//===:- strict equality for comparison ,checked the values as well as data types
//eg - console.log(50=="50")==> returns false as data type is not matched

//[3]Logical Operator:
//i)AND & ii)OR || iii)NOT !

//[4]Assignment operator: <,>,<=,>=,== etc..
